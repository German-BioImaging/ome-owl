Hence, the spatial distance of the Image positions of a Point-like object (i.e., Spot or Point Emitter) located in the centre of the Field of View (FOV) for different excitation and detection Wavelength bands is denoted as co-registration accuracy. The co-registration accuracy shall be calculated from the Intensity maxima or the Intensity centre of gravity of the Image of the Point-like object for the different Wavelengths. The lateral co-registration accuracy is expressed as: [Lambda]lateral = ã(x[lambda]1 - x[lambda]2)^2 + (y[lambda]1 - y[lambda]2)^2; and the axial co-registration accuracy is expressed as: [Lambda]axial = ã(z[lambda]1 - z[lambda]2)^2."@en .

This check is necessary because often NA regulation in these types of Objectives occurs via a rotating collar whose exact position is difficult to measure and reproduce across different Experiments. In this context, setting the collar to the Maximum NA position is desirable not only because it is more easy to reproduce and it best to estimate the maximal resolution of the system."@en .

    rdfs:comment "Property \"nyquistRate\" captures the ratio between the Pixel Size and the Nyquist Criterion. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem establishes that \"when sampling a signal (e.g., converting from an analog signal to digital), the sampling frequency must be greater than twice the Band Width of the input signal in order to be able to reconstruct the original perfectly from the sampled version\" (Whittaker E.T., (1915). Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A, 25:181; Shannon C.E., (1949) Proc. IRE, 37:10). The Nyquist Criterion determines the minimal Sampling Density needed to capture ALL information from the Specimen into the Image. It can be shown that if the Sampling Density is higher than the Nyquist Rate (also referred to as Critical Sampling Distance) all information about the object is captured. It is important to note that the Nyquist Rate depends on the Objective Numerical Aperture (NA) and on the Excitation and Emission WaveLengths. The recommended Nyquist Rate is > 2 for conventional light microscopy, and it is 2.5 - 3 for high resolution imaging."@en .

    rdfs:comment "Class \"ChromaticRegistrationEvaluationt\" referes refers to the results of a specific Co-registration Accuracy evaluation assay associated with this Optical Calibration procedure. According to ISO 21073:2019, co-registration accuracy measures the capacity of a microscope system to image a fluorescent object with different excitation and emission Wavelengths at the same position in the Image. Hence, the spatial distance of the Image positions of a Point-like object (i.e., Spot or Point Emitter) located in the centre of the Field of View (FOV) for different excitation and detection Wavelength bands is denoted as co-registration accuracy. The co-registration accuracy shall be calculated from the Intensity maxima or the Intensity centre of gravity of the Image of the Point-like object for the different Wavelengths. The lateral co-registration accuracy is expressed as: [Lambda]lateral = ã(x[lambda]1 - x[lambda]2)^2 + (y[lambda]1 - y[lambda]2)^2; and the axial co-registration accuracy is expressed as: [Lambda]axial = ã(z[lambda]1 - z[lambda]2)^2."@en .
